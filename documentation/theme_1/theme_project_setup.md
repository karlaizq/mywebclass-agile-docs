# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Using Agile and Lean methodologies, the project will be approached in a "pull" development approach with a focus on a single goal. The project goal is to create MyWebClass, a website that requires a development team to work collaboratively to produce various content that supports the website objectives. To achieve this, the team will first create a basic web template that addresses legal requirements and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner. The website template must also be SEO optimized, which will enable it to be found using a search engine. Additionally, the website must legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site.

The plan will include three major parts. Firstly, Basic Project Documentation and Project Management, which will outline the project's goals and provide a roadmap for the team. Secondly, DevOps will be established to support the development of the project. Finally, the MyWebClass.org base website template will be created, including all technical and legal requirements, and will be SEO optimized. This website template will enable the website to be appropriately listed in search engines and legally use Google Analytics.

The project will be developed iteratively, with each iteration focusing on the completion of the project's goals. The team will work collaboratively and in parallel to ensure that the project is completed efficiently and effectively. Agile methodologies will be used to adapt to changing circumstances and to continuously improve the development process. The Lean approach will ensure that the project is developed in the most efficient way possible, with a focus on eliminating waste and maximizing value.
